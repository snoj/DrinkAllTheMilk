Drink all the Milk

While watching Hak5 1106, I wondered if it would be possible to do a similar thing but with encrypted volumes instead of encrypting/decrypting and file copying.


THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
I'm no excryption connosier or pen tester, so I don't know if this method is better really. Additionally, I'm fairly new to linux scripting 

LICENSE
As far as I care, this is a public domain work and is probably very unstable...we are mucking with the shadow file after all. Use at your own RISK.

USING
Prereq: php5

#install
sudo make install

#create encrypted img with a copy of the current /etc/shadow file.
sudo datm-setup

#you will find a file called "en-shad.img" under /root. Copy this to your usb thumb/jump drive.

HOW IT WORKS

	drinkallthemilkd watches for new mounts in /media that contain en-shad.img. (ls /media/*/en-shad.img)

	If one is found it attempts to use the skey found in /etc/drinkallthemilk to do a losetup/cryptsetup/mount process on the file. 
	
	Once the file is mounted it then copies /etc/shadow to /etc/shadow.drinkallthemilk, deletes the original and places a link to the one on the thumb drive.
	
	When the drive is removed, the process is reversed and the original shadow file is restored.
	
NOTES
	Written and tested on Ubuntu 11.10.
